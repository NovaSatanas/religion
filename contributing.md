# Contributing to Obsolism

## Who's allowed to contribute?

One of the core ideas of Obsolism is its fluidity. As such, contributions from
all people are welcome.

## How do I contribute?

Only Priests and the High Priest have push access to the Holy Repository. As
such, all amendments to Obsolism must be approved by a member of the High
Council.

### GitHub

The easiest way to propose an amendment is by forking this repository and
creating a pull-request on GitHub that details your reasoning for making
changes. Prior Git knowledge is assumed.

### Pure Git

If for some reason you are prevented from utilizing GitHub or would simply
rather avoid it, you can create a "pull-request" the old-fashioned way by
getting in touch with a member of the High Council and providing your case as
well as a valid Git remote URL they can pull from.

### Other

Of course there are more ways to contribute than simply modifying the
repository. Any contributions in the form of suggestions, ideas, discussion,
etc. are also appreciated. You may find use in the GitHub 
[issues](https://github.com/obsolism/obsolism/issues) or
[discussions](https://github.com/obsolism/obsolism/discussions) tabs, or in
other locations like the 
[Obsolism Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#obsolism:matrix.org) or simply
just by connecting with a Priest directly.

## What do I get for contributing?

There are no rewards offered at this time (or likely ever) apart from the simple
gratification of having contributed to this religion and having your name
eternally carved in the Holy Repository's git logs.
