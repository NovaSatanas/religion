# Contributing to Obsolism

## Who's allowed to contribute?

One of the core ideas of Obsolism is its fluidity. As such, contributions from
all people are welcome.

## How do I contribute?

### GitHub

The easiest way to contribute is by forking this repository and creating a
pull-request on GitHub that details your reasoning for making changes. Prior Git
knowledge is assumed.

### Pure Git

If for some reason you are prevented from utilizing GitHub or would simply
rather avoid it, you can create a "pull-request" the old-fashioned way by
getting in touch with an Obsolist priest and providing your case as well as a
valid Git remote URL they can pull from.

### Other

Of course there are more ways to contribute than simply modifying the
repository. Any contributions in the form of suggestions, ideas, discussion,
etc. are also appreciated. You may find use in the GitHub 
[issues](https://github.com/obsolism/obsolism/issues) or
[discussions](https://github.com/obsolism/obsolism/discussions) tabs, or in
other locations like the 
[Obsolism Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#obsolism:matrix.org) or simply
just by connecting with a priest directly.

## What do I get for contributing?

There are no rewards offered at this time (or likely ever) apart from the simple
gratification of having contributed to this religion and having your name
eternally carved in the holy Git logs.
