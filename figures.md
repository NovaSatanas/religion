# Obsolist Figures

Some people and characters that are relevant to the practice of Obsolism.

## The Tyrant *(Fictional)*
Other names:
* God
* The Father
* Yahweh
* Jehovah

The Tyrant is the patriarch of Judaistic religions including Judaism, Christianity, Mormonism, and others. He rules unchecked and without remorse. While supposedly omniscient, he reacts instinctively and angrily to events that should have been forseen. He creates vague and arbitrary rules and punishes disobedience with death followed by eternal suffering while claiming to be a forgiving and loving "god". 

## The Rebel *(Fictional)*
Other names:
* Lucifer
* Satan
* The Devil

The Rebel is the primary antagonist of the afforementioned Judaistic religions alongside humanity itself. Even while created simply as a scapegoat for evil, the cracks in Christianity's moral grounds reveal themselves as we find much to revere in the character of Satan. He stands up to tyrany, advocates for equal rights, welcomes all races and sexualities, and doesn't shun the mentally ill. The Rebel treats you as an adult and recognizes your freedom to indulge in 'sins' such as:
* Premarital sex
* Masterbation
* Wearing whatever clothing you choose (including torn clothing, polyester, gold, pearls and other 'costly garments')
* Eating pork, fat, blood, or seafood
* Tattooing your skin
* Trimming the corners of your beard
* Possessing foreskin
* If you are a women: Speaking while attending church
* Working on the sabbath (Saturday)
* Remarrying after divorce
* Divorce itself
* Gossip

All these things are considered worthy of death in the eyes of The Tyrant, but The Rebel seeks to recognize your autonomy.
