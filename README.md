# Religion

Withing this Git repo lies one entire religion, including every sacred text, rule, and other relevant documents.

This README serves to provide a short introduction to the religion and as a directory to guide you through the contents of this repo.

## Intent

As a society we cannot seem to leave religion behind, we desperately cling to it and drag its lifeless body with us forward through time. The religion as defined within this repository seeks to be a suitable candidate for
the doctrine to end all doctrines. It leaves behind reckless hate, vestigial traditions, and arbitrary morals with the hopes of guiding people to science and a common, neue morality. This neue morality exists only to serve
the health society, as does law.

Furthermore, this religion is dynamic and shall not be frozen or branched. As we progress in our pursuit of knowledge, we should update our values and traditions to reflect the new and relinquish the old. There will be no
versioning, only current and non-current. It is recommended to pull from this repo at least once a year so that one does not unknowingly adhere to non-current information.

## Formats

All files herein will be in Unicode with the exception of images. Unicode files will have an extension identifying their syntax just as this file does. Note the `.md` referring to the markdown format. Each document
will exist in only one format. To elaborate, if something is written as JSON it will not also be distributed as YAML, and vice versa. If need be, it is permitted to locally convert between these formats on your own system
using software you trust, however the resulting converted files do not legally or ethically represent the religion as they may have been tainted. Do not share or partake in shared copies of this information, simply clone it
yourself. The only official source of information is a clone of this repo that has run `git fetch` and verified as unchanged and up to date.
