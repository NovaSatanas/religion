# Rituals

Rituals are unnecessary, arbitrary, and often a sign of the ability to let go of
spiritualism. That being said, the United States of America requires a legally
recognized religion to observe its own rituals, hence this document.

## Unbaptism

With a sharp object cut a cross into your skin - or don't. Recognize that you
have no obligation to do anything that you would prefer not to.

## Hallows Eve

On October 31st at 21:00 hours watch the movie Halloween (1978). If anyone
attempts to prevent you from watching said film, please inform them that by
doing so they are inhibiting your religious freedom and, by extension, your
constitutional rights (if you are a citizen of the United States).
