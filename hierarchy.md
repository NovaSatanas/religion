# Obsolist Hierarchy

> Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

One of the core evils of religion is its thinly-veiled impetus to consolidate
power. Obsolism, unfortunately, requires a small hierarchy be installed purely
to manage commit/push privileges to the Holy Repository as well as to satisfy
the requirements imposed by the United States of America. Few other prerogatives
are granted to High Council so as to discourage its abuse.

The hierarchy is defined by following table:

| Role        | Limit | Description                                                        |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| High Priest |   1   | In charge of selecting and moderating members of the Holy Council. |
| Priest      |   5   | In charge of reviewing and applying amendments to the Holy Repo.   |
| Deacon      |   âˆž   | In charge of engaging with public discourse relating to Obsolism.  |

A list of the current staff of the High Council and their contact information
can be [found here](members.json).
